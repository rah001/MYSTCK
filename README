Hi! Welcome to the Readme for the Mystic Ticket System.
-- Last Updated: 11/17/07

Features
	- Mystic is a ruby on rails ticket system, that's designed to be fast,
	  flexible, and customizable. Tickets are used for several purposes, from 
          project management, customer help/troubleshooting, and much more.
          Here are some of the highlights of this application: 
		1. User/Tech/Admin login system
		2. Custom ticket category and status editing.
		3. Different Themes available.

Installing
	- Please read INSTALL 
Using
	- There are 3 example accounts that come along with mystic when you
	  first install. There is one regular user, one tech(what an employee
	  or similar would be, that replies to user tickets), and one admin(who
	  is the one who managers users/techs/admins, etc. Here is where and how
	  you can log in as these users:
		* Let's assume you have mystic installed at: http://mystic.domain.com
	
	  You can log in as a regular user at:
		http://mystic.domain.com or http://mystic.domain.com/user/
                     - Username: user@test.com 
                     - Password: test 

	  You can log in as a tech at:
		http://mystic.domain.com/tech/
                     - Username: tech@test.com 
                     - Password: test 

	  You can log in as an admin at:
		http://mystic.domain.com/admin/
                     - Username: admin@test.com 
                     - Password: test 

	- Having logged in, here are some guidelines/faqs: 
                - All tickets that are marked as resolved disappear from the
                  tech & admin area. The ticket created by the particular user
                  will always be seen in the user area. 

                - What happens if a user tries to log into a tech/admin area?
                  There is an automatic check that locks a tech/admin/user into
                  their own area. An admin can't log in as a user or vice versa.
 
Rake Tasks
	- Run rake --tasks to see all of the rake tasks. They all start with "mystic:",
	  and they're super useful! here are some examples:
		- mystic:fill_with_sample_data : automatically fills the database with 
		  5000 users,  10000 tickets, 50000 posts, wow! This is for testing
		  mystic with a huge database filled with tickets and users and what
		  not. We use this for performance testing so we can tune mystic to 
		  super-high load enterprise environments. Be sure to get rid of all 
 		  this sample data before lauching your ticket system!

		- mystic:clean_logs : this task automatically cleans out any logs
		  that are 6 months or older. Logs can build up pretty quickly, and 
		  this is a good way to clean them out. We reccommend that you set 
		  this rake task up as a cron job. 

Enjoy Mystic! Visit our site: http://www.hulihanapplications.com to let us know
about anything you're curious about or if you see any bugs/problems! We're constantly 
trying to update Mystic to make it the best open source ticketing system ever. We can't 
do that if we don't know what everyone wants, so if you see a feature you'd like, let
us know, that's what we're here for!

Thanks!
